### Two version of python on Pi, how to make python 3 the default interpreter

Find out which python version is used per default. 
```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ which python
/usr/bin/python

pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ls -al /usr/bin/python
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root staff 16 May 29 19:01 /usr/bin/python -> python2 
```

At the moment is python2 the default version on Linux, and we have to change the default to python 3. 

***
**A quick solution but error prone**

Since the file starts with an `l` in its attributes, it indicates that it is a `link` where /usr/bin/python is linked to Python 2. 

While I easily could change this link to Python 3, it is probably not the best choice! Upon updating Python, I would find that the link would have been updated back to the original link location pointing to Python 2. 

***
**An easier solution but still NOT 100% save** 

Set up a `shell alias`:

```alias python=/usr/local/bin/python3```

Type that at a prompt, better to make the change to be persistent put it in `~/.bashrc` , and now when I type python it runs the chosen python 3, but when some program on the system tries to run a script with /usr/bin/ python it runs the standard 2.7!

***
**A stable solution an my recommendation !!!**

Create your own link in a directory that's listed in the path prior to the usr/bin path, or /usr/bin path. In this case below, the */usr/local/bin path is listed prior /usr/bin*. 

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ echo $PATH
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/local/games:/usr/games
```
I create a link to Python 3 in the directory /usr/local/bin, it will be found before the link in the directory /usr/bin pointing to Pyhton 2.  
```
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/python3 /usr/local/bin/python
```

To make sure I clear my hash, cache, of any paths like typing python, I type `hash â€“r`.
If I enter now `python` on the command line, I will have the pyhton 3 interpreter available! 
```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ python
