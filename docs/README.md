## Python classes

### Basic class 1
The class did not provided the option to download the presented code samples. I took my own notes and a subset of the covered code is stored here: https://github.com/kapahnke-iot/python/tree/master/basic-class-1
* `Read input from keyboard` and `print a text message concatenated` with the input: https://github.com/kapahnke-iot/python/blob/master/basic-class-1/input_print.py

### Basic class 2
The complete source code will be stored here: https://github.com/kapahnke-iot/python/tree/master/basic-class-2
